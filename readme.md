# Casnic Surveillance Android Application

The simplest RTSP server that uses the phone's camera and microphone.

Uses code from [fyhertz/libstreaming](https://github.com/fyhertz/libstreaming/tree/2.2). The license is maintained at the top of those files, but the package definition was changed from `net.majorkernelpanic` to `com.assortedsolutions`. The initial commit of the files contain only the package definition change. All further changes are my own and retain the original license.
